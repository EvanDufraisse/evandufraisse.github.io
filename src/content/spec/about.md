# About me

I got into programming early on and have been hooked on computers ever since. I'm really curious and driven, so I specialised in Operations Research at IMT Atlantique in 2019 and then moved on to Deep Learning, getting an MSc in Computer Science from Georgia Tech in 2021. I then went on to do a PhD at CEA List and Loria, working on an interdisciplinary project that brought together computer scientists, economists and political scientists to design algorithms aimed at reducing societal polarisation. My own work involved modelling articles using language models.

I'm currently working as a research engineer at CEA List, where I'm interested in NLP, deep learning and their applications. I'm also a teaching assistant in machine learning and computer science at the University of Paris-Saclay and Centrale Supélec.

In my spare time, I enjoy working on side projects, reading and running – lots of running!
